<h1>Preparation for a CS Degree</h1>

<br>

<h2>Why Prepare Ahead?</h2>
<p>Embarking on a CS degree can be both thrilling and challenging. By preparing ahead, you set yourself up for success
    and make the transition into higher education smoother. Building a solid foundation in key concepts before you even
    step into the classroom can help you grasp complex topics more easily and excel in your coursework.</p>

    <br>

<h2>1. Strengthen Your Math and Logic Skills:</h2>
<p>Computer Science is built upon a strong foundation of mathematics and logic. Brush up on your algebra, calculus,
    and discrete mathematics skills. Familiarize yourself with concepts like logic gates, truth tables, and mathematical
    proofs. These skills will be essential for understanding algorithms, data structures, and problem-solving in programming.</p>

    <br>

<h2>2. Dive into Programming Languages:</h2>
<p>While you don't need to be a coding wizard before entering your CS program, getting comfortable with basic programming
    concepts can give you a head start. Start with a beginner-friendly language like Python. Learn about variables, loops,
    conditionals, and functions. These fundamentals will serve as building blocks for more complex coding challenges down the road.</p>

    <br>

<h2>3. Get Hands-On with Projects:</h2>
<p>Start working on small coding projects to apply what you've learned. These can be personal projects or contributions
    to open-source projects. Not only do projects enhance your coding skills, but they also showcase your passion and
    dedication to potential professors and employers.</p>

    <br>

<h2>4. Develop Problem-Solving Skills:</h2>
<p>CS is all about solving complex problems efficiently. Practice solving puzzles, brainteasers, and logic problems to
    sharpen your analytical thinking. Platforms like <a class="b_jm" href="https://leetcode.com/"target="_blank">LeetCode</a>, 
    <a class="b_jm" href="https://www.hackerrank.com/"target="_blank">HackerRank</a>, and 
    <a class="b_jm" href="https://codesignal.com/CodeSignal"target="_blank">CodeSignal</a> offer a wide range of coding
    challenges that mirror real-world problem-solving scenarios.</p>

    <br>

<h2>5. Learn to Collaborate:</h2>
<p>In the real world, software development is a collaborative effort. Practice teamwork and communication skills by
    participating in group projects or hackathons. Learning how to work effectively with others will benefit you both academically and professionally.</p>

    <br>

<h2>6. Familiarize Yourself with Tools:</h2>
<p>Start getting acquainted with development environments, version control systems like Git, and text editors. While
    these may seem daunting initially, they become indispensable tools once you're in your CS program.</p>
