<h1>Computer Architect </h1>

<div class = "text_block">
    <p>
        A computer architect is a computer science professional who designs and develops the 
        high-level structure of computer systems. The role of a computer architect involves making strategic 
        decisions about the design and organization of hardware and software components to ensure optimal 
        performance, efficiency, and functionality of computer systems. A few of the things that computer architects work on are as follows:

        <h2>System Design</h2>
        <p>Computer architects who focus on system design focus on the internal hardware of the computer. This includes but is not limited
             to the CPU (Central Processing Unit), HDD (Hard Disk Drive), and the RAM (Random Access Memory)</p>

        <h2>Instruction Set Architecture</h2>
        <p>Computer architects who focus on instruction set design work on the computers software. These architects focus on coding the 
            software that executes on the processors that help the computer to run and optimize them.
            </p>

        <h2>Microarchitecture</h2>
        <p>Computer architects who work on microarchitecture work with the machines data logic and
             interpretation. This helps the machine understand its instructions and perform accordingly.</p>
