<h1>Life as a Computer Science Student</h1>

<div class="life_text_block_zf">

        Life as a Computer Science student is typically full of hands on learning and research.
        Many days will be spent going between classes and studying in between. If you go to a good university for Computer Science, 
        you will most likely be doing a lot of hands on coding.
        <br>
        One of the most important skill for studying in Computer Science is research. You will be presented with new technology,
        programming languages, software, and more. Being able to efficiently research something new to you will greatly improve your 
        ability to do course work.
        <br><br>
        Here is a short list of languages that I had to learn as a Computer Science student <br>
        <div class = "life_ul_zf">
            <li>Java</li>
            <li>C++</li>
            <li>JavaScript</li>
            <li>Python</li>
            <li>Assembly</li>
            <li>Ruby</li>
        </div>
        <br><br>
        As you can see, these languages that are listed are varied and all have different syntax and uses. Learning (and still 
        discovering new things) about these languages required research outside of class time.
        <br>
        All of the hard work that goes into learning, course work, and research will hopefully lead into the next step: Getting 
        a job!
